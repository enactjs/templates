// skin.less
//

// Themes can decide their own interpretation of what is defined as a "skin".
// Some themes define a skin as specifically the colors, and leaving all measurements and sizes in
// the variables.less file. This allows their users to change skins without any layout changes at
// all, since only colors are swapped out. Other themes have decided a broader implementation is
// best, having a separate variables file for each skin, so they can do more elaborate changes with
// each skin. This is why our colors and variables files are separate.
//
// To define a new skin, simply duplicate the `:global() {}` block and choose a new skin name that
// is defined in the Skinnable component.
//
// To switch from a colors-&-variables skin approach to a just-colors skin approach, simply move the
// `@import variables` line above the `:global` line so it allows all skins below to reference the
// same set of variables.
